# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Analysis for theater play kickstarters in order to startegize the right plan for Louise  
Out of all the parent categories found Theaters have the most kickstarters

I focused specifically on theaters as parent categories and plays as subcategories
Out of 912 theater kickstarters 525 were successful
Out of 314 plays kickstarters 238 were successful
Looking at outcomes based on launch date May appears to be the best time to start a theater kickstarter since that month contains the largest amount of successful outcomes
I separated data based on Louise's experience with some of her favorite plays in Edinburgh; Be Prepared, Checkpoint 22, Cutting Off Kate Bush, Jestia and Raedon and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family
I made two separate worksheets for Successful US Kickstarters and Failed US Kickstarters for plays
I took those separate data sets and made comparisons based on the goal amount and pledged amount within various descriptive statisitcs. I have also made a Box and Whisker chart to identify outliers and distributions in Great Britain plays
Based on my findings:
* The mean goal of Failed kickstarters were almost double the amount of Successful kickstarters; the goals were set too high 
* The mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. If failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects
* mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so data follows similar distributions in each subset
* the standard deviations are larger than the mean which means everything below the mean is considered close to the center
* the standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR, resulting in failed kickstarters with really high goals
* The 1st quartile of pledges are at $0 so about 25% of them were not funded at all, they may not have gotten enough exposure for people to pledge for them
* The mean campaign goal is around 4,000 euros, this is outside the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than 4,000 euros. Half of the campaign goals are less than 2,000 euros, which is just over the 3rd quartile

In Conclusion, Louise should plan to start her U.S. kickstarter in May with a budget of around $2,000. She should also consider advertising her play on various social media sites and getting the word out as much as she can to increase the exposure of her kickstarter. All of these factors will help increase the likelihood that her kickstarter will succeed.
